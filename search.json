I am available more often than not, so try dropping me a line via Discord or email if you are having a problem with your lab or want to set up a time. You may also contact the lab assistant(s) for questions when I am not available.\nReadings for each lecture are listed on the schedule below. Many students say they have found the readings valuable and enjoyable.

    "text": "Course Learning Objectives\nDigital systems have revolutionized our world. From television to cell phones to GPS to warfare to medicine to automobiles, computers and digital processing have reshaped the way we live and work. Computers are also a vital part of daily practice in every field of science and engineering.\nPrevious generations of engineers learned the “nuts and bolts” of the profession by doing things like disassembling and rebuilding engines. As technology has advanced, cars have become too complicated for the layperson to work on. Ironically, the same advances have made computers much easier to build. While most fields of engineering require extensive mathematics and complicated analysis of even rather simple components, digital systems merely require counting from 0 to 1. Their challenge, instead, is in combining many simple building blocks into a complex whole. Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), containing the equivalent of thousands or millions of logic gates, make it possible to build these complex systems in the lab without the tedium of manually connecting components. In this class, you will build your own microprocessor and test it on a FPGA. In the process, you will master the art and science of digital design. You will learn to speak to and control processors in their native tongue, assembly language. And you will put all the pieces together to demystify how a computer works.\nAs you probably know, very few complex systems work the first time you put them together. Engineers must become good at systematically and efficiently debugging their creations. One of the course objectives that can be frustrating but vitally important is to learn to teach yourself professional-strength computer-aided design tools and to use these tools to debug systems.\nBy the end of this course, you should be able to:\n\nBuild digital systems at levels of abstraction from transistors through circuits and logic.\nManage complexity using the digital abstraction, static and dynamic disciplines, and hierarchical design.\nDesign and implement combinational and sequential digital circuits using schematics and hardware description languages.\nAnalyze and trade off performance, cost, and power consumption of digital circuits.\nBegin the practice of implementing and debugging digital systems with appropriate lab techniques including breadboarding and interpreting datasheets.\nSimulate digital circuits"

    "text": "Course Policies\n\nDeadlines\nLabs and homework are due by the end of class. You may have a one-week extension on one assignment of your choice (except Lab 11) and are responsible for tracking this yourself under the honor code (no need to notify the instructor; just turn it in with the following week’s assignment). Your lowest problem set and lab grade will each be dropped. Please ration your extension and drops carefully lest you find yourself ill at the end of the semester and out of options. The class moves quickly and it is difficult catching up if you fall behind. Contact the Academic Deans (academicdeans@g.hmc.edu) if you have or anticipate a protracted situation; they can coordinate additional flexibility for this class and/or others.\n\n\nDrops and Deadline Flexibility\nYour lowest problem set and lab grade of the semester will each be dropped, as will your three lowest lecture practice assignments. The dropped lab and problem set are intended to accommodate illness, travel, and personal emergencies. However, if you have already used your drop and need flexibility on a second lab or problem set, please contact the instructor at least two days in advance for an extension. The class moves quickly and it is difficult to catch up if you fall behind. Handling extensions in the MOOC is cumbersome, so late lecture practice questions are not accepted.\nBased on last year’s experience, it is likely that multiple people in the class will experience prolonged illness and/or mental health challenges during these difficult times. If you find yourself in this circumstance, please reach out to the Academic Deans as soon as you can. They are great advocates who can help arrange flexibility across your multiple classes. E85 will make unusual accommodations as needed in such circumstances. The sooner you report a problem, the more likely it is that the deans can help you find a graceful solution.\n\n\nCollaboration Policy\nYou are welcome to discuss labs and problem sets with other students or with the instructor or lab assistants or tutors after you have made an effort by yourself. However, you must turn in your own work, not work identical to that of another student. For labs, asking classmates or tutors for help when you are stuck on a specific issue is encouraged (especially on difficulties with the tools and equipment), but sitting at adjacent computers and working through the lab together in lock-step is specifically prohibited. Pair/group programming is also prohibited, as is getting your answer from an AI tool, search engine, or other source that bypasses your own critical thought and opportunity to practice the material. It is an honor code violation to simply copy someone else’s work.\n\n\nAI Policy\nAn exception to the AI policy is that each week’s problem set will have one optional problem in which AI is required rather than prohibited. You can use ChatGPT or any other AI tool. The question will be worth one point of extra credit, not to bring the problem set total above 100%. You may photograph the question into the AI app, or cut and paste it into the prompt. Learning objectives include:\n\nBegin to understand what AI is and is not capable of answering in this technical discipline\nCritically assess the quality of the answer, including whether the AI is hallucinating, and whether the solution is similar, better, or worse than what you would have done yourself in a reasonable amount of time.\nExplore modifying your prompt to get a better answer if the initial answer is unsatisfactory."

If this document does not clarify the legitimacy of a particular action, you should contact the course instructor and request clarification.\nWork you submit for individual assignments should be your own, and you should complete all assignments based on your own understanding of the underlying material. If you work with, or receive help from, another individual on an assignment, provide a written acknowledgement in complete sentences that includes the person’s name and the nature of the help.\nThis document is not meant to be an exhaustive list of every possible Honor Code violation. Infractions not explicitly mentioned here may still violate the Honor Code.\nBoundaries of Collaboration Verbal collaboration with other students on individual assignments is encouraged AFTER you have given serious thought to each component yourself. However, all submitted written work should be written by yourself individually, and not a collaborative effort or copied from a common source (e.g., a chalkboard). It is NOT acceptable to work on labs in lockstep with another classmate.\nUse of Computer Software The use of graphing calculators and computer software to aid in course work is acceptable, as long as it does not substitute for an understanding of the course material.\nUse of Web Resources The use of Internet resources to aid in course work is acceptable, as long it does not substitute for an understanding of the course material. Plagiarism and direct copying from online (or any other) sources is strictly prohibited.\nUse of Your Own Work from Previous Semesters If you have previously attempted this course, you may resubmit your work from previous semesters as this semester’s coursework, as long as you understand the underlying material.\nUse of Other Course Resources from Previous Semesters You may not reference assignments (labs, problem sets, activities) of this course from previous semesters.\nRetention of Course Resources Assignments and exams from this course may not be committed to dorm repositories or otherwise used to help future students."
